## About
I am a B.Sc. Data Science student at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Dortmund (FH Dortmund) with a passion for building trustworthy AI-driven products. My work bridges data pipelines, backend services, and human-centered interfaces so that insights become actionable tools.

## Spotlight Projects
- [AI-Image-Detector](https://github.com/realr4an/AI-Image-Detector) highlights AI-generated faces using YOLO-based extraction, TensorFlow classifiers, and Streamlit dashboards.
- [SecureTextEditor](https://github.com/realr4an/SecureTextEditor) combines a React frontend and Spring Boot backend to deliver encrypted document workflows.
- [LeagueOfLegendsMinimapTracker](https://github.com/realr4an/LeagueOfLegendsMinimapTracker) captures minimap events to upskill decision making for League of Legends players.
- [keypass](https://github.com/realr4an/keypass) is a minimalist CLI password vault written in C with AES protection.
- [MiniGeoLocator](https://github.com/realr4an/MiniGeoLocator) merges multiple APIs for resilient IP geolocation in JavaScript.
- [streamlit_apps](https://github.com/realr4an/streamlit_apps) collects rapid Streamlit experiments for data exploration and prototyping.

## Toolbox
- **Data Science and ML:** Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow), R, applied ML and deep learning, visualization with matplotlib and seaborn.
- **Backend and Data:** SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SAP HANA), data warehousing, Cassandra, Spring Boot, REST API design.
- **Frontend and UX:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Streamlit, UI patterns, accessibility-first thinking.
- **Software Engineering:** Java, C, C++, C#, OOP and SOLID foundations, algorithms and data structures, Git-based collaboration.
- **Security and Systems:** Operating systems, network fundamentals, cryptography principles, information and mobile security.

## Experience Snapshot
- SHK tutor at FH Dortmund, supporting algorithms and programming fundamentals (since 2025).
- Working student at w3logistics AG, delivering production logistics features across 2023 to 2024.
- Internship rotations in application development and systems integration at itemis AG, ThyssenKrupp, and Entireinfra.

## Currently Exploring
- Deployable AI services with explainability, monitoring, and guardrails.
- Security hardening strategies for full-stack applications and developer workflows.
- Data storytelling techniques that connect analysis to impactful decisions.

## Education
- B.Sc. Data Science, FH Dortmund (2022 to present).
- Prior Computer Science studies, TU Dortmund (2021 to 2022).
- Information technology track, Hellweg-Berufskolleg Unna (2018 to 2021).
